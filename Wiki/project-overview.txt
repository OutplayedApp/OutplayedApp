Project Definition:

Outplayed.app is a simple webapp where users can go to play quick games
against one another. Users are able to compete against other and be given
a rating and corresponding rank, depending on outcomes of their games. Games
are built to be fast, fun, as well as based on skill rather than luck, while
only being less than 30 seconds in length.
